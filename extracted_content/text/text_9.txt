Special wards

The 23 special wards of Tokyo are the same area that had been called Tokyo City. On July 1, 1943, Tokyo City was merged with Tokyo Prefecture ( , Tōkyō-fu) to become a special government area. This made the wards different from other wards in Japan. Other city wards are part of a larger city government, but these are not. Each ward is a municipality with its own mayor and assembly like the other cities of Japan. The special wards often use the word city in their official English name, e.g. Chiyoda City.

The wards have a unique administrative relationship with the prefectural government. The Tokyo Metropolitan Government manages some public works such as water, sewer, and fire- fighting. To pay for these things, the prefecture collects the municipal taxes usually collected by a city.[19]
