      "📝 Answer: Tokyo started as a small fishing village named Edo in the old Musashi Province. The Edo clan built walls to protect the town in the late 12th century, and in 1457, Ōta Dōkan built Edo Castle. In 1590, Tokugawa Ieyasu made Edo his base and became shogun in 1603, making the town the center of his military government. This marked the beginning of the Edo period, during which Edo grew into one of the largest cities in the world. \n",

      "Although Edo was not the capital of Japan, it held more power due to the shogun's influence. The Meiji Restoration in 1869 removed the shogun from power, and the 17-year-old Emperor Meiji moved to Edo, transforming the old Edo Castle into the Kokyo, the Imperial Palace. \n",
